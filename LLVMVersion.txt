    [InstCombine] canonicalize a scalar-select-of-vectors to vector select

    This pattern may arise more frequently with an enhancement to SLP vectorization suggested in PR42755:
    https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42755
    ...but we should handle this pattern to make things easier for the backend either way.

    For all in-tree targets that I looked at, codegen for typical vector sizes looks better when we change
    to a vector select, so this is safe to do without a cost model (in other words, as a target-independent
    canonicalization).

    For example, if the condition of the select is a scalar, we end up with something like this on x86:

	    vpcmpgtd        %xmm0, %xmm1, %xmm0
	    vpextrb $12, %xmm0, %eax
	    testb   $1, %al
	    jne     LBB0_2
      ## %bb.1:
	    vmovaps %xmm3, %xmm2
      LBB0_2:
	    vmovaps %xmm2, %xmm0

    Rather than the splat-condition variant:

	    vpcmpgtd        %xmm0, %xmm1, %xmm0
	    vpshufd $255, %xmm0, %xmm0      ## xmm0 = xmm0[3,3,3,3]
	    vblendvps       %xmm0, %xmm2, %xmm3, %xmm0
